# Festival For the Future - Interactive Wall Display
This is a an interactive wall which uses displacement to draw the outlines of a moving object with a slight delay. If you stop moving, the image will fade.

This is a project I am working on for FFTF

You can download a compiled version for MacOS here: N/A

Enjoy :)
